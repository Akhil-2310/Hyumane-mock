## 🎯 Mission

We are on a mission to foster **genuine human interaction and connection** amidst the overwhelming rise of AI-generated content and bots.

Hyumane isn't just about preventing bot accounts — it's about protecting the **human element** in digital communication and ensuring that both **accounts and content** remain authentic.

---

## 🚨 Problem

In today’s online world, **AI bots are everywhere** — even on social media platforms that are meant to be *social*. 

This results in:
- Fake engagements
- Spammy content
- A lack of trust in digital identities

Ultimately, we're losing the **real connections** that these platforms were built to create.

---

## ✅ Solution

Hyumane is solving this by:
- Verifying **every profile** using **zk-proof-based human verification**
- Ensuring **only real humans** can create and maintain accounts
- In **Version 2**, integrating an **AI content detector** to block non-human generated content

With zk tech, we verify users **without compromising their privacy**, offering a seamless yet trustworthy experience.

## 🔮 Future Plans (V2)

- 🧠 **AI Content Detection**: Identify and reduce AI-generated "slop" on the platform
- 🔐 **Expanded ZK Use-Cases**: Extend zk-verification to content authorship, voting, and more
